# Azure AI Foundry Hub Environment

This [Azure AI Foundry Hub Environment](./ai-hub-environment.bicep) template demonstrates how to set up a workspace in the Azure AI Foundry for building, testing, and deploying AI solutions with AI models from the Azure AI model catalog. This example provides a public internet access enabled environment secured by Microsoft Entra ID authentication via Azure Managed Identity with least-privilege Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for secure access to the dependent resources.

This deployment can be accessed via the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/build/).
